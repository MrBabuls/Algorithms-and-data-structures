# Programming Weekly Tasks

In this project, each weekly course task is implemented in its **own `.h` and `.cpp` files**, which are added to the project.  

- This keeps each task separate and the code easy to maintain.  
- `main.cpp` calls the necessary functions to run each task.  
- For new tasks, create a new `.h/.cpp` pair and add it to the project.

## Tasks

- [Programming Task 2 – Linear and Binary Search](Assignments/LinearAndBinarySearch.cpp)
- [Programming Task 3 – Fibonacci and Ackermann](Assignments/FibonacciAndAckermann.cpp)
- [Programming tasks 4 - Sorting algorithm](Assignments/SimpleSort.cpp)
- [Programming tasks 5 - List ADT](Assignments/LinkedList.cpp)
- [Programming tasks 6 - HTML-checker](Assignments/HtmlChecker.cpp)
